         * There are multiple ways to customize a phase from JHipster.
         *
         * 1. Let JHipster handle a phase, blueprint doesnt override anything.
         * ```
         *      return super._initializing();
         * ```
         *
         * 2. Override the entire phase, this is when the blueprint takes control of a phase
         * ```
         *      return {
         *          myCustomInitPhaseStep() {
         *              // Do all your stuff here
         *          },
         *          myAnotherCustomInitPhaseStep(){
         *              // Do all your stuff here
         *          }
         *      };
         * ```
         *
         * 3. Partially override a phase, this is when the blueprint gets the phase from JHipster and customizes it.
         * ```
         *      const phaseFromJHipster = super._initializing();
         *      const myCustomPhaseSteps = {
         *          displayLogo() {
         *              // override the displayLogo method from the _initializing phase of JHipster
         *          },
         *          myCustomInitPhaseStep() {
         *              // Do all your stuff here
         *          },
         *      }
         *      return { ...phaseFromJHipster, ...myCustomPhaseSteps };
